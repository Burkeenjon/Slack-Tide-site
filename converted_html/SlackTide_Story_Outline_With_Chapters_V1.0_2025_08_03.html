<p>Slack Tide – 7-Part Story Structure with Chapter Breakdown</p>
<p>1. Hook (Chapters 1–2)</p>
<p>Sara infiltrates a remote estate outside Bogotá. The Solace gala unfolds in Vienna. The duality is stark.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Intercut – Sara on mission, Adrien at gala.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Sara refuses the kill order and vanishes, setting the tone for her break from Solace.</p>
<p>2. Inciting Incident (Chapter 3)</p>
<p>Sara severs contact, disables her tracking, and disappears into the open ocean. She becomes a ghost.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Descent into the sea. First signs of psychological stress. Sara sets a course for the Pacific.</p>
<p>3. First Plot Point (Chapters 4–5)</p>
<p>Sara joins a drifting cruiser fleet—'the cursers.' The anonymity offers peace but doesn’t erase her past.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Arrival in the cruiser anchorage. Introduction of new faces.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Flashbacks intercut with her cautious bonding in the community.</p>
<p>4. Midpoint / Reversal (Chapters 6–9)</p>
<p>A coded message or encounter reveals Solace’s ops are still tracking her. Worse—she learns sparing the child didn’t stop the operation.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Signal detected.</p>
<p>Chapter 7: A boat from the past docks nearby. Tension.</p>
<p>Chapter 8: She confronts the cruiser who brought the signal.</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Sara realizes the shadow branch is deeper than Adrien’s reach.</p>
<p>5. Second Plot Point (Chapters 10–12)</p>
<p>Her cover is blown. A friend is hurt. Sara goes on the defensive.</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Local betrayal. Traced via supplies or systems.</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Fight or flight. Tactical retreat into the outer atolls.</p>
<p>Chapter 12: She recovers data proving shadow ops activities.</p>
<p>6. Climax (Chapters 13–15)</p>
<p>Sara executes a silent op. No blood. No bodies. Only exposure.</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Infiltration prep using resources from her cruising contacts.</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Data release – leak to someone outside the system (journalist, watchdog, or Solace board).</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Aftermath – Solace responds publicly, Adrien appears rattled, unaware of full extent.</p>
<p>7. Resolution (Chapters 16–17)</p>
<p>Sara sails solo into open water. She’s free—but alone.</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Goodbyes, quietly handled. She gifts tools, not explanations.</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Onboard Nymeria, she reflects, plans no future—but leaves no traces either.</p>
<p>Epilogue – Echo Below</p>
<p>A ghost signal from a dead drop. A dive to recover a cache: flash drive, journal, and WWII coordinates.</p>
<p>A forgotten sub base in an uncharted lagoon.</p>
<p>The next journey waits beneath the waves.</p>
