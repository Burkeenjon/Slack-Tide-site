<p>Dive-Only Dead Drop Sites – Field Brief for Sara</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>This field brief outlines a series of remote, unpopulated maritime locations in the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean where Sara can retrieve or deploy covert underwater supply caches. Each site is selected for its isolation, available anchorage, and underwater concealment potential. The caches are accessible only by diving, offering maximum stealth and narrative intrigue.</p>
<p>Site 1: Sabina Shoal</p>
<p>Location: Spratly Islands, South China Sea</p>
<p>Coordinates: ~9° 45′ N, 116° 28′ E</p>
<p>Status: Uninhabited reef structure with submerged flats and narrow reef lagoon</p>
<p>Anchorage: West-side shallow patch (2–8m), suitable only in calm conditions</p>
<p>Dive Depths: 4–20m</p>
<p>Cache Concept: Coral cave or reef crevice with a weighted pelican case or dive bell pod hidden inside.</p>
<p>Narrative Potential: Enemy drones scan surface traffic, but Sara free-dives to recover a cache that contains encrypted comms gear and biometric disguises.</p>
<p>Site 2: Nikumaroro Atoll</p>
<p>Location: Phoenix Islands, Republic of Kiribati</p>
<p>Features: Historic ruins, overgrown structures, shallow western reef access, isolated lagoon</p>
<p>Anchorage: Reef shelf near colonial pier</p>
<p>Dive Depths: 6–12m</p>
<p>Cache Concept: Ammo canister or PVC tube buried in lagoon floor or wedged in coral behind ruins</p>
<p>Narrative Potential: Inside a rusted cistern under collapsed radio equipment lies a black PVC tube marked in Veil glyphs—meant for someone else.</p>
<p>Site 3: Rongerik Atoll</p>
<p>Location: Marshall Islands (east of Bikini Atoll)</p>
<p>Status: Entirely uninhabited; part of former U.S. nuclear exclusion zone</p>
<p>Anchorage: Large central lagoon, sandy bottom</p>
<p>Dive Depths: 5–15m</p>
<p>Cache Concept: Waterproof ammo canister lodged inside one of the lagoon’s blast craters</p>
<p>Narrative Potential: Retrieval before an algal bloom sets in. One cache is missing—the crater empty but for a single torn glove.</p>
<p>Site 4: Tuamotu Drift Channel</p>
<p>Location: French Polynesia</p>
<p>Feature: Strong drift current between two motu (islets)</p>
<p>Anchorage: Lagoon side, accessible by dinghy</p>
<p>Dive Depths: 6–12m</p>
<p>Cache Concept: Weighted pelican case bolted to reef block</p>
<p>Narrative Potential: A timed current dive; any delay means the current sweeps Sara away into shark territory.</p>

<p>Deployment & Retrieval Notes</p>
<p>- Tide Timing: Especially critical at Sabina and Tuamotus where currents shift dramatically</p>
<p>- Stealth Approach: Sara must use a dinghy or kayak to minimize detection from satellite or drone surveillance</p>
<p>- Cache Marking: GPS point encoded via glyph cipher, or a marked rock/buoy above drop site</p>
<p>- Environmental Hazards: Rongerik may become toxic seasonally; Tuamotus attract reef sharks during current surges</p>
<p>Optional Enhancements</p>
<p>- Each site can include coded glyphs or hidden Veil-tech objects</p>
<p>- Other factions may have planted older caches</p>
<p>- One cache contains a tracker or decoy – Sara must assess on the fly</p>
