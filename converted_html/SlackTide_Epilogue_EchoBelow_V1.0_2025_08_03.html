<p>Epilogue – Echo Below</p>
<p>Somewhere in the South Pacific – 17:42 hours</p>
<p>Sara was nearly done patching the mainsail when the console chirped.</p>
<p>Just once. A staccato burst. Shortwave. Low band. The kind of signal no one used anymore—except people like her. Or the ones she used to work for.</p>
<p>She wiped her hands on a rag and crossed to the nav station. The LED readout blinked once, then again.</p>
<p>DROP 4: WAKE.</p>
<p>Her breath caught in her throat. No one should know those codes still existed. Let alone where they pointed.</p>
<p>The Wake site was one of four—underwater caches she’d seeded across a dozen countries during her black years. This one sat on a sloped reef outside the atoll’s safe zone. Sixty feet down, anchored in coral, invisible to sonar, forgotten even by her.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Three days later</p>
<p>The water was warm. Blue as breath. Quiet enough to feel sacred.</p>
<p>Sara descended with slow, practiced control. Every movement precise, fluid, deliberate.</p>
<p>The reef curved like a crescent below her, its coral ridges sheltering schools of neon fish and skeletal fanweed. Nestled in a cavity half-shielded by rock and growth, the cache case waited—black carbon shell, barnacle-streaked, just where she’d left it six years ago.</p>
<p>She unlatched the anchor clamps, detached the buoyant tether, and began the slow rise back to the surface.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Onboard Nymeria, she opened it.</p>
<p>Inside: a vacuum-sealed journal, ink-smudged but intact. A flash drive. And a single laminated card bearing nothing but old military coordinates, faded kanji, and one line in English:</p>
<p>“JINTAO REEF – SUB PEN – 1944 – UNCHARTED”</p>
<p>She stared at it for a long time.</p>
<p>Then, without a word, she stood and walked to the helm.</p>
<p>The tide was shifting.</p>
