<p>4. Origin & Solace History</p>
<p>
Sara was raised in a coastal town. Her mother disappeared at sea under suspicious circumstances. Her father died during an underfunded, hazardous maintenance job tied indirectly to a Solace logistics arm.

At 15, with no legal guardians, Sara was absorbed into a Solace program known as Bastion Nine. She quickly rose as a Tier-1 operative — not because of connections, but because of performance. She became known internally as “the perfect assassin,” for kills that never needed clean-up.
</p>
<p>5. The Break</p>
<p>
Sara left after witnessing a sanctioned op result in the unnecessary death of a child. A note in the ops file simply said: “Too far.” It was written by someone inside. She didn’t speak up. She disappeared — with subtle assistance from others who silently agreed.

She didn't rage. She executed one final act of refusal: walking away.
</p>
<p>6. The Boat – Marrow Tide</p>
<p>
A Garcia Exploration 45. Steel-hulled. Cutter-rigged. Solar-assisted with redundant systems. She found it docked under an unmonitored registry. Bought it using recovered funds and under-the-table exchanges. It has become her sanctuary, her weapon, and her only home.
</p>
<p>7. The Island – Jintao Reef</p>
<p>
A forgotten WWII Japanese submarine pen carved into limestone in the South China Sea. Radar-shielded inlet, partially flooded docks, and a tunnel-linked commander’s residence. It offers nothing but isolation, which is exactly what she wants.
</p>
<p>8. Why Solace Let Her Go</p>
<p>
Sara wasn’t missed because she wasn’t visible. She was trained to disappear — and that’s what she did. Internally, a few quietly let her go, without record or protest. Solace chose not to hunt her for four reasons:

1. She was a ghost by design.
2. Some inside agreed with her.
3. She remains useful, even without allegiance.
4. She’s more dangerous dead than gone — and they know it.

They didn’t release her.  
They simply didn’t stop her.
